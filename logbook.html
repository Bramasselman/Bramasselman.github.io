            <h4>IATA Codes web scraping</h4>

            In order to identify the broken itineraries, one should look for three main things.
             First of all, the sequence of flights within the itinerary should be respected.
             Secondly, every next flight should leave later than the previous flight added by the transit time.
             Finally, one should take into account that for domestic and continental flight a maximum delay of 18 hours is allowed, while for intercontinental flight the allowed delay is 36 hours.
             To determine whether or not a flight is domestic/continental/intercontinental, all current IATA airport codes and the respective country were scraped from the web.
             This way, it becomes convenient to write an efficient function that identifies the type of flights.

            <h4>Retrieve Broken Itineraries</h4>

           Broken itineraries were retrieved based on the criteria listed in the assignment.
           The passengers part of these itineraries were sorted based on the potential downgrading cost (a passenger flying first class
           can lead to a large penalty if he/she is downgraded to economy class). This is why based on this criteria the passengers were sorted
           before adding them to the shortest path loop. More explanation on the shortest path algorithm and implementation is given
           in <a href="shortest_path.html">Shortest Path</a>.

            <h4>Remaining Empty Seats for each Flight</h4>

           After having defined the broken itineraries (and thus passengers that need to be assigned to another (set of) flight(s),
                the amount of passengers that are part of the non-broken itineraries can be found. This amount is then subtracted from the capacity per flight.
                This way, the amount of remaining seats for each flight number was obtained. This number will be particularly useful when assigning passengers form broken
                itineraries to new flights.

            <h4>Shortest path algorithm</h4>

            For passengers with cancelled itineraries, starting with passengers inducing highest costs, a shortest path
            was set-up with the network origin being their departure airport and the network sink being their arrival
            airport.
            Along all existing flights with available seating capacity, a path with minimum cost was found and
            passengers were assigned to those flights. This process was repeated until all passengers were assigned
            flights, making sure that all passengers would end up at the desired destination.
